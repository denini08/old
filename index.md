# Denini Silva — Ph.D. Candidate

Welcome! I'm Denini Silva, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the Federal University of Pernambuco (Recife, PE – Brazil), advised by [Prof. Dr. Marcelo d’Amorim](https://cin.ufpe.br/~damorim/). I'm 27 years old and passionate about computing, particularly software engineering.

Since 2020, I’ve been involved in academic research. After completing my M.Sc. in Computer Science (2022), I started my Ph.D. with a focus on software testing, especially in the Android ecosystem.

My research interests include:
- Software Engineering  
- Programming Languages  
- Software Testing  
- Software Development
